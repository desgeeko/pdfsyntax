PDFSyntax
=========

*A Python library to inspect and transform the internal structure of PDF files*

## Introduction

The project is focused on chapter 7 ("Syntax") of the Portable Document Format (PDF) Specification. It implements all the detailed document structure management down to the byte level for inspection and transformation use cases (access to metadata, rotation,...).

- Internal functions are being exposed as an API toolkit for PDF read/write operations,
- Some specific functions are additionally exposed as a command line interface for use in a terminal or a  browser.

PDFSyntax is lightweight (no dependencies) and written from scratch in pure Python, with a focus on simplicity and immutability.

It favors non-destructive edits allowed by the PDF Specification: by default incremental updates are added at the end of the original file (you may rewind or squash all revisions into a single one).

## Project status

WORK IN PROGRESS! This is BETA quality software. The API may change anytime.
Next on TO-DO list:
- Cut & append pages
- Lossless compression
- More filters
- Improve text extraction
- Augment text extraction with layout detection

## Installation

You can install from PyPI:

    pip install pdfsyntax

## CLI overview

Please refer to the [CLI README](https://github.com/desgeeko/pdfsyntax/blob/main/docs/cli.md) for details.

The general form of the CLI usage is:

    python3 -m pdfsyntax COMMAND FILE

You can get quick insights on a PDF file with these commands:
- `overview` outputs text data about the structure and the metadata.
- `disasm` outputs a dump of the file structure on the terminal.
- `text` outputs extracted text spatially, as if it was a kind of scan.
- `fonts` outputs list of fonts used.
- `browse` outputs static html data that lets you browse the internal structure of the PDF file: the PDF source is pretty-printed and augmented with hyperlinks.

## API overview

Please refer to the [API README](https://github.com/desgeeko/pdfsyntax/blob/main/docs/api.md) for details.

PDFSyntax is mostly made of simple functions. Example:

```Python
>>> from pdfsyntax import readfile, metadata
>>> doc = readfile("samples/simple_text_string.pdf")
>>> metadata(doc) #returns a Python dict whose keys are 'Title', 'Author', etc...
```

The Doc object is probably the only dedicated class you will need to handle. It is a black box that stores all the internal states of a document:
- content that is cached/memoized from an original file,
- modifications that add/modifiy/delete content and that are tracked as incremental updates.

```Python
>>> doc
<PDF Doc in revision 1 with 0 modified object(s)>
```

This object exposes as a method the same metadata function, therefore you can get the same result with:

```Python
>>> doc.metadata() #returns a Python dict whose keys are 'Title', 'Author', etc...
```

Low-level functions like `get_object` or `update_object` allow you to directly access and manipulate the inner objects of the document structure.
You may also use higher-level functions like `rotate`:

```Python
>>> from pdfsyntax import rotate, writefile
>>> doc180 = rotate(doc, 180) #rotate pages by 180Â°
```

The original object is unchanged and a new object is created with an incremental update (revision 2) that encloses the ongoing orientation modification:

```Python
>>> doc180
<PDF Doc in revision 1 with 1 modified object(s)>
```

You then can write the modified PDF to disk. Note that the resulting file contains a new section appended to the original content. You may cut this section to revert the change.

```Python
>>> writefile(doc180, "rotated_doc.pdf")
```


## Open-Source, not Open-Contribution yet

PDFSyntax is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/desgeeko/pdfsyntax/blob/main/LICENCE) but is currently closed to contributions.
> Personal note: this is a pet projet of mine and my time is limited. First I need to focus on my roadmap (new features and refactoring) and then I will happily accept contributions when everything is a little more stabilised.
